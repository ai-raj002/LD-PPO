## 🔬 How PPO Works for Load Balancing

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

PPO is a policy gradient method that:
1. **Learns a policy** to select which VM to route requests to
2. **Optimizes resource utilization** by balancing load across VMs
3. **Uses clipped objective** to prevent large policy updates
4. **Maximizes reward** based on:
   - Low CPU usage
   - Low memory usage
   - Low bandwidth usage
   - High priority (lower priority number)
   - Balanced load distribution

### Environment

The load balancing environment:
- **State Space**: Normalized resource metrics (CPU, memory, bandwidth, score, priority, time) for each VM
- **Action Space**: Discrete selection of which VM to route a request to
- **Reward Function**: Combines multiple objectives:
  - Resource availability (lower usage = higher reward)
  - Priority consideration
  - Load balancing fairness

### Training Process

1. The agent observes the current state of all VMs
2. Selects an action (VM) based on the current policy
3. Receives a reward based on the selected VM's state
4. Updates the policy using PPO algorithm
5. Repeats to learn optimal load balancing strategy

## 📊 Data Format

The CSV files should contain the following columns:
- `no`: Record number
- `fetch`: Fetch number
- `update`: Update flag (0 or 1)
- `vm_id`: Virtual machine ID
- `vm_name`: VM name
- `cpu_usage`: CPU usage (0-1)
- `max_cpu`: Maximum CPU capacity
- `mem_usage`: Memory usage (bytes)
- `max_mem`: Maximum memory capacity
- `cum_netin`: Cumulative network input
- `cum_netout`: Cumulative network output
- `rate_netin`: Network input rate
- `rate_netout`: Network output rate
- `bw_usage`: Bandwidth usage
- `max_bw`: Maximum bandwidth
- `score`: Load balancing score
- `priority`: Priority level (1-4)
- `unix_timestamp`: Unix timestamp
- `timestamp`: Human-readable timestamp

## 🎛️ Configuration

### PPO Hyperparameters

- **Learning Rate**: Controls how fast the model learns (typically 0.0001-0.01)
- **Training Steps**: Number of training iterations
- **Batch Size**: Number of samples per update (typically 32-512)
- **Epochs per Update**: Number of times to iterate over the batch
- **Discount Factor (γ)**: How much future rewards are valued (0.9-0.99)
- **Clip Range**: Clipping parameter for PPO (typically 0.1-0.3)

## 📈 Metrics Explained

### Load Balance Index
Measures how evenly load is distributed across VMs. Lower values indicate better balance.

### Resource Variance
Variance in resource usage across VMs. Lower variance means more balanced load.

### Overall Efficiency
Normalized measure of load balancing efficiency (0-100%).

### Throughput
Number of requests processed per second.

### Resource Fairness
Coefficient of variation-based measure of fairness in resource distribution.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **File Not Found**: Ensure CSV files are in the same directory as `app.py`

3. **Memory Issues**: For large datasets, consider:
   - Reducing training steps
   - Using smaller batch sizes
   - Processing data in chunks

4. **Training Takes Too Long**: 
   - Reduce number of training steps
   - Use smaller batch sizes
   - Reduce number of epochs per update
